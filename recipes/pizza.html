    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Dough</h3>

        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li> 
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li> 
    </ol>

    </ol>

        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Bake the Pizza</h3>

        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or extra Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
